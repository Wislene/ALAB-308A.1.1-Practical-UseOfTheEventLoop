// Part 2: Trampolines: only need to do part 1

// Instruction: 

// ---- Using try/catch blocks does not solve the root issue of a stack overflow; it just handles the resulting error. What if you are implementing a recursive function that needs to call itself 30,000 or 50,000 times? While the use cases for that are rare, they do exist.

// ----Once you have familiarized yourself with the logic behind this process, accomplish the following:
// Write a recursive function that completely flattens an array of nested arrays, regardless of how deeply nested the arrays are.
// Once your recursive function is complete, trampoline it.
