// Part 3: Deferred Execution: only need to do part 1

// Another practical manipulation of the event loop is through “deferred execution” of tasks when working in a browser environment.
// Using setTimeout, you can place tasks into the event queue. This sets the task to be executed after the current call stack is cleared and after the browser has had a moment to render.
// Implement the following:
// Create a simple HTML element to hold text. Cache this HTML element into a JavaScript variable.
// Write a function that takes a parameter n and adds a list of all prime numbers between one and n to your HTML element.
// Once complete, use the alert() method to alert the user that the calculation is finished.
